      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and
        managing BGP, including protocol, policy, and operational
        aspects based on data center, carrier and content provider operational requirements.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>
        YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> is a data modeling language that was
        introduced to define data for managing networked devices using NETCONF
        <xref target="RFC6241"/>. YANG is proving relevant beyond its initial
        confines, as bindings to other interfaces (e.g. ReST) and encodings
        other than XML (e.g. JSON) are being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data
        models can be used as the basis of implementation for a number of
        interfaces, such as CLIs and  programmatic APIs (e.g., see <xref
        target="I-D.talwar-rtgwg-grpc-use-cases" />).
      </t>

      <t>
        This document describes a YANG data model for the <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> protocol, including various protocol extensions, policy configuration, as well as defining key operational state data.  The model is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow
        operators to manage BGP configuration in heterogeneous
        environments with routers supplied by multiple vendors.  The
        model is also intended to be readily mapped to existing
        implementations to facilitate support from as large a
        set of routing hardware and software vendors as possible.
      </t>
      <section title = "Goals and approach" anchor="goals">
        <t>
          The model covers the base BGP features that
          are deployed across major implementations and the
          common BGP configurations in use across a number of
          operator network deployments. In particular,
          this model attempts to cover BGP features defined in
          <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>, <xref target="RFC1997"></xref>,
          <xref target="RFC4456"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4760"></xref>,
          <xref target="RFC3065"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2439"></xref>,
          <xref target="RFC4724"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC6811"></xref>.
        </t>

        <t>
          Along with configuration of base BGP features, this model also
          addresses policy configuration, by providing "hooks" for applying
          policies, and also defining BGP-specific policy features.  The
          BGP policy features are intended to be used with the general
          routing policy model defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model" />.
          The model also supports operational state data to provide a common model for reading BGP-related state from a BGP speaker.
        </t>
        <t>
         For the base BGP features, the focus of the model described in this document is on providing configuration and operational state information
         relating to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The global BGP instance, and neighbors whose configuration is
            specified individually, or templated with the use of peer-groups.
           </t>
           <t>
             The address families that are supported by peers, and the
             global configuration which relates to them.
           </t>
           <t>
             The policy configuration "hooks" and BGP-specific policy
             features that relate to a neighbor - controlling the import and export of NLRIs.
           </t>
         </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          As mentioned earlier, any configuration items that are
          deemed to be widely available
          in existing major BGP implementations are included in the
          model.  Additional, more esoteric, configuration items that are not
          commonly used, or only available from
          a single implementation, are omitted from the model with an
          expectation that they will be available in companion modules that
          augment or extend the current model.  This allows clarity in identifying
          data that is part of the vendor-neutral base model.
        </t>

        <t>
          Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions
          used in available standards documents, and otherwise tries to
          be self-explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the
          intended behavior.  Similarly, configuration data value
          constraints and default values, where used, are based on
          recommendations in current standards documentation, or those commonly
          used in multiple implementations.  Since implementations can vary
          widely in this respect, this version of
          the model specifies only a limited set of defaults and ranges
          with the expectation of being more prescriptive in future
          versions based on actual operator use.

    <section title="Model overview" anchor="overview">
      <t>The BGP model is defined across several YANG modules and submodules,
        but at a high level is organized into six elements:
      </t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> base protocol configuration -- configuration affecting BGP
            protocol-related operations, defined at various levels
            of hierarchy.
          </t>
          <t> multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting
            individual address-families within BGP <xref target="RFC4760" />.
          </t>
          <t> neighbor configuration -- configuration affecting an
            individual neighbor within BGP.
          </t>
          <t> neighbor multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting
            individual address-families for a neighbor within BGP.
          </t>
          <t> policy configuration -- hooks for application of the policies
              defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model" />
              that act on routes sent (received) to (from)
              peers or other routing protocols and BGP-specific policy features.
          </t>
          <t> operational state -- variables used for monitoring and
            management of BGP operations.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        These modules also make use of standard Internet types, such
        as IP addresses and prefixes, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in
        <xref target="RFC6991">RFC 6991</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Throughout the model, the approach described in <xref
        target="I-D.openconfig-netmod-opstate" /> is used to represent
        configuration (intended state), operational and derived state data.
        That is to say, that each container holds a "config" and "state"
        sub-container - with the config container being used for configurable
        parameters, and the state container container holding
        both the operational state of configurable leaves, and derived
        counters and statistical information.
      </t>
        <section title="BGP protocol configuration"
          anchor="overview.protocol">
          <t>The BGP protocol configuration model is organized
            hierarchically, much like the majority of router
            implementations.  That is, configuration items can be
            specified at multiple levels, as shown below.
          </t>

            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>
            Users may specify configuration at a higher level and
            have it apply to all lower-level items, or provide
            overriding configuration at a lower level of the
            hierarchy. Overriding configuration items are optional, with
            neighbor specific configuration being the most specific or lowest
            level, followed by peer-group, and finally global.
            Global configuration options reflect a subset of the
            peer-group or neighbor specific configuration options which
            are relevant to the entire BGP instance.
          </t>
          <t>
            The model makes the simplifying assumption that most of
            the configuration items are available at all levels of the
            hierarchy.  That is, very little configuration is specific
            to a particular level in the hierarchy, other than obvious
            items such as "group-name" only being available for the
            peer group-level config.  A notable exception is for
            sub-address family configuration where some items are only
            applicable for a given AFI-SAFI combination.
          </t>
          <t>
            In order to allow common configuration to be applied to
            a set of neighbors, all neighbor configuration options
            are available within a peer-group. A neighbor is associated
            to a particular peer-group through the use of a peer-group
            leaf (which provides a reference to a configured item in
            the peer-group list).
          </t>
          <t>
            Address-family configuration is made available in multiple
            points within the model - primarily within the global container,
            where instance-wide configuration can be set (for example,
            global protocol parameters, the BGP best path route selection options,
            or global policies relating
            to the address-family); and on a per-neighbor or per-peer-group
            basis, where address-families can be enabled or disabled, and
            policy associated with the parent entity applied. Within the afi-safi
            container, generic configuration that applies to all address-families
            (e.g., whether the AFI-SAFI is enabled) is presented at the top-level,
            with address-family specific containers made available for options
            relating to only that AFI-SAFI. Within the current revision of the model
            a generic set of address-families, and common configuration and state
            options are included - further work is expected to add additional parameters
            to this area of the model.
          </t>
          <t>
            The following address-families are currently supported by the model:

            represents a condition-action policy framework for routing. This

          anchor="overview.operational">
          <t>
            The BGP operational model contains data which
            relates to the operational state of the various elements of the
            BGP router. As noted in <xref target="overview" /> - the approach
            described in <xref target='I-D.openconfig-netmod-opstate' /> is
            utilized for the inclusion of operational and statistical data. To
            this end, the "-state" groupings (those that contain derived
            operational parameters) are contained within the BGP operational
            model - and included within the relevant "state" containers throughout
            the core BGP model. In some cases, operational information may be
            relevant to one instance of a common grouping, but not another - for
            example, the number of received, advertised, and installed prefixes is
            relevant on a per-neighbor-basis, but is not required (or meaningful)
            in the peer-group context. Groupings are defined with the appropriate
            operational state data accordingly.
          </t>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Relation to other YANG data models">
      <t>
        The BGP model is intended to work within a larger framework model, such
        as the Network Instance model <xref target="I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-network-instance" />
        which provides a comprehensive model for defining
        VRFs, associated routing protocols, multiple protocol instances, and
        inter-protocol and inter-instance routing policies.  The current version
        of the model imports and instantiates the BGP model in its tree at
        /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/...
      </t>
      <t>
        It is also possible to integrate the BGP model with the Routing
        Management model <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg" /> or the
        Network Device Organizational Model <xref target="I-D.rtgyangdt-rtgwg-device-model" />,
        both of which define the notion of routing instances,
        or VRFs.

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>BGP configuration has a significant impact on network operations,
      and as such any related protocol or model carries potential
      security risks.
      </t>

      <t>YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the
      NETCONF protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an
      authenticated and secure channel over which to transfer BGP
      configuration and operational data.  Note that use of
      alternate transport or data encoding (e.g., JSON over HTTPS)
      would require similar mechanisms for authenticating and
      securing access to configuration data.
      </t>

      <t>Most of the data elements in the configuration model could be
      considered sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized
      access or invalid data could cause major disruption.
