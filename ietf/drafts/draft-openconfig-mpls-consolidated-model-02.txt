1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC6020] data model for MPLS and
   traffic engineering, covering label switched path (LSP)
   configuration, as well as signaling protocol configuration.  The
   model is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators
   to manage MPLS in heterogeneous environments with physical or virtual
   devices (routers, switches, servers, etc.) supplied by multiple
   vendors.  The model is also intended to be readily mapped to existing
   implementations, to facilitate support from as large a set of routing
   hardware and software vendors as possible.

1.1.  Goals and approach

   The focus area of the model in this revision, is to set forth a
   framework for MPLS, with hooks into which information specific to
   various signaling-protocols can be added.  The framework is built
   around functionality from a network operator perspective rather than

Internet-Draft               MPLS / TE Model                October 2015


   a signaling protocol-centric approach.  For example, a traffic-
   engineered LSP will have configuration relating to its path
   computation method, regardless of whether it is signaled with RSVP-TE
   or with segment routing.  Thus, rather than creating separate per-
   signaling protocol models and trying to stitch them under a common
   umbrella, this framework focuses on functionality, and adds signaling
   protocol-specific information under it where applicable.

   This model does not aim to be feature complete (i.e., cover all
   possible aspects or features of MPLS).  Rather its development is
   driven by examination of actual production configurations in use
   across a number of operator network deployments.

   Configuration items that are deemed to be widely available in
   existing major implementations are included in the model.  Those
   configuration items that are only available from a single
   implementation are omitted from the model with the expectation they
   will be available in companion modules that augment the current
   model.  This allows clarity in identifying data that is part of the
   vendor-neutral model.

   An important aspect of the model is the representation of operational
   state data.  This draft takes the approach described in
   [I-D.openconfig-netmod-opstate] and models configuration and
   operational state together.  Thus, rather than building a separate
   tree of operational state, the operational state and configuration
   data are located in parallel containers at the leaves of the data
   model.  This approach allows easy reuse of groupings across models,
   as well as making it easier to correlate configuration and state.

   The consolidated MPLS model encompasses the signaling protocols,
   label-switched paths (configuration and operational state), and
   generic TE attributes.  The model is designed from an operational and
   functional perspective, rather than focusing on protocol-centric
   configuration.  This allows protocol-independent functions to be
   logically separated from protocol-specific details.

   One question that arises in this approach is how the consolidated
   model is integrated with routing instances (e.g., VRFs).  This model
   should be considered as part of a higher level network device model
   which includes definitions for other routing protocols and system
   services.  For example, in [I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-structure],
   VRFs and other logical instances are defined with MPLS/TE components
   within VRFs as appropriate.  In particular, some parts of the MPLS
   model would be instantiated within a VRF, while other parts would
   have common definitions across VRFs.

   Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions used in
   available standards documents, and otherwise tries to be self-
   explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the intended behavior.
   Similarly, configuration data value constraints and default values,
   where used, are based on recommendations in current standards
   documentation.  Since implementations vary widely in this respect,
   this version of the model specifies only a limited set of defaults
   and ranges with the expectation of being more prescriptive in future
   versions based on actual operator use.

   Note that this version of the model is a work-in-progress in several
   respects.  Although we present a complete framework for MPLS and
   traffic engineering from an operational perspective, some signaling
   protocol configuration will be completed in future revisions.  The
   current revision has focus on traffic engineered LSPs signaled with
   RSVP.

2.  Model overview

   The overall MPLS model is defined across several YANG modules and
   submodules but at a high level is organized into 4 main sections:

   o  global -- configuration affecting MPLS behavior which exists
      independently of the underlying signaling protocol or label
      switched path configuration.

   o  te-global-attributes -- configuration affecting MPLS-TE behavior
      which exists independently of the underlying signaling protocol or
      label switched path configuration.

   o  signaling protocols -- configuration specific to signaling
      protocols used to setup and manage label switched paths.

   o  label switched paths -- configuration specific to instantiating
      and managing individual label switched paths.

   The top level of the model is shown in the tree view below:

2.1.  MPLS global

   The global section of the framework provides configuration data for
   MPLS items which exist independently of an individual label switched
   path or signaling protocol and are applicable to the MPLS protocol
   itself.  Items such as the depth of the label stack supported, or
   specific label ranges may be included here.

2.2.  TE global attributes

   The TE global attributes section of the framework provides
   configuration control for MPLS-TE items which exist independently of
   an individual label switched path or signaling protocol.  These
   standalone items are applicable to the entire logical routing device,
   and establish fundamental configuration such as the threshold for
   interface bandwidth change that triggers update events into the IGP
   traffic engineering database (TED).  Timers are also specified which
   determine the length of time an LSP must be present before being
   considered viable for forwarding use (te-lsp-install-delay), and the
   length of time between LSP teardown and removal of the LSP from the
   network element's forwarding information base (te-lsp-cleanup-delay).
   Also specified are the name to value mappings of MPLS administrative
   groups (mpls-admin-groups) and shared risk link groups (mpls-te-
   srlg).

         ...

2.4.  Signaling protocol overview

   The signaling protocol section of the framework provides
   configuration elements for configuring three major methods of
   signaling label switched paths: RSVP-TE, segment routing, and label
   distribution protocol (LDP).  BGP-LU will be included in a future
   version of this draft by definitions in the BGP model
   ([I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model]) and corresponding augmentations to the
   MPLS model.

         |     ...
         |  +--rw ldp
         |     ...

   Configuration of RSVP-TE is centered around interfaces on the device
   which participate in the protocol.  A key focus is to expose common
   RSVP-TE configuration parameters which are used to enhance scale and
   reliability.  Items which are applicable globally in the RSVP-TE
   protocol such as graceful restart, soft preemption and various
   statistics are grouped into a global section under the protocol.
   RSVP neighbor and session state are also available in the RSVP
   section.

         |  |        +--rw protection
                     ...
         ...

   Containers for specifying signaling via segment routing and LDP are
   also present.  Specific subelements will be added for those
   protocols, as well as for BGP labeled unicast, in the next revision.

2.5.  LSP overview

   This part of the framework contains LSP information.  At the high
   level, LSPs are split into three categories: traffic-engineering-
   capable (constrained-path), non-traffic-engineered determined by the
   IGP (unconstrained-path), and hop-by-hop configured (static).

            |     ...
            +--rw static-lsps
                  ...

   The first two categories, constrained-path and unconstrained-path are
   the ones for which multiple signaling protocols exist, and are
   organized in protocol-specific and protocol-independent sections.
   For example, traffic-engineered (constrained path) LSPs may be set up
   using RSVP-TE or segment routing, and unconstrained LSPs that follow
   the IGP path may be signaled with LDP or with segment routing.  IGP-
   determined LSPs may also be signaled by RSVP but this usage is not
   considered in the current version of the model.

   A portion of the data model for constrained path traffic-engineered
   LSPs signaled with RSVP is shown below.  It contains configuration
   for named explicit paths and for tunnels.  Tunnel configuration
   differs for p2p and p2mp LSPs.  In either case, some part of the
   model is signaling-protocol independent.  For example for a p2p LSP,
   attributes such as the path computation method, the constraints for
   the the path, the bandwidth allocated to it, and even the frequency
   of reoptimization are signaling-protocol independent, while other
   data, such as the setup and hold priorities are protocol-specific and
   are specified in the protocol specific part of the model.

3.  Example use cases

3.1.  Traffic engineered p2p LSP signaled with RSVP

   A possible scenario may be the establishment of a mesh of traffic-
   engineered LSPs where RSVP signaling is desired, and the LSPs use a
   local constrained path calculation to determine their path.  These
   LSPs would fall into the category of a constrained-path LSP, and the
   tunnel type is p2p.  Attributes such as metric, bandwidth or the
   style of protection desired are also defined at this (protocol-
   independent) level in the model.  The path is defined to be locally-
   computed under the path-computation-method container, specifying the
   use of CSPF (use-cspf).  Additional attributes for the path, such as
   its RSVP priorities are specified at the path level under the
   protocol-specific stanza.

3.2.  Traffic engineered LSP signaled with SR

   A possible scenario may be the establishment of disjoint paths in a
   network where there is no requirement for per-LSP state to be held on
   midpoint nodes within the network, or RSVP-TE is unsuitable (as
   described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] and
   [I-D.shakir-rtgwg-sr-performance-engineered-lsps]).  Such LSPs fall
   in the constrained-path category.  Similar to any other traffic
   engineered LSPs, the path computation method must be specified.  Path

   attributes, such as the as lsp- placement-constraints (expressed as
   administrative groups) or metric must be defined.  Finally, the path
   must be specified in a signaling- protocol specific manner
   appropriate for SR.  The same configuration elements from the tree
   above apply in this case, except that path setup is done by the head-
   end by building a label stack, rather than signaled.

3.3.  IGP-congruent LDP-signaled LSP

   A possible scenario may be the establishment of a full mesh of LSPs.
   When traffic engineering is not an objective, no constraints are
   placed on the end-to-end path, and the best- effort path can be setup
   using LDP signaling simply for label distribution.  The LSPs follow
   IGP-computed paths, and fall in the unconstrained-path category in
   the model.  Protocol-specific configuration pertaining to the
   signaling protocol used, such as the FEC definition and metrics
   assigned are in the path- setup-protocol portion of the model.

   The relevant part of the model for this case is shown below:

     +--rw mpls!
         +--rw lsps
            +--rw unconstrained-path
               +--rw path-setup-protocol
                  +--rw ldp!
                     +--rw tunnel
                        +--rw tunnel-type?   mplst:tunnel-type
                        +--rw ldp-type?      enumeration
                        +--rw p2p-lsp
                        |  +--rw fec-address*   inet:ip-prefix
                        +--rw p2mp-lsp
                        +--rw mp2mp-lsp

   A common operational issue encountered when using LDP is traffic
   blackholing under the following scenario: when an IGP failure occurs,
   LDP is not aware of it as these are two protocols running
   independently, resulting in traffic blackholing at the IGP failure
   point even though LDP is up and running.  LDP-IGP synchronization
   [RFC5443] can be used to cost out the IGP failing point/segment to
   avoid the blackholing issue.  The LDP-IGP synchronization function
   will be incorporated in a future version of this document.

   Note that targeted LDP sessions are not discussed in this use case,
   and will be incorporated as a separate use case in a future version
   of this document.

4.  Security Considerations

   MPLS configuration has a significant impact on network operations,
   and as such any related protocol or model carries potential security
   risks.

   YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the NETCONF
   protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an authenticated and
   secure channel over which to transfer BGP configuration and
   operational data.  Note that use of alternate transport or data
   encoding (e.g., JSON over HTTPS) would require similar mechanisms for
   authenticating and securing access to configuration data.

   Most of the data elements in the configuration model could be
   considered sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized access
   or invalid data could cause major disruption.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This YANG data model and the component modules currently use a
   temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If and when it is placed on redirected
   for the standards track, an appropriate namespace URI will be
   registered in the IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  The MPLS YANG
   modules will be registered in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   [RFC6020].

6.  YANG modules

   The modules and submodules comprising the MPLS configuration and
   operational model are currently organized as depcited below.

   The base MPLS module includes submodules describing the three
   different types of support LSPs, i.e., traffic-engineered
   (constrained-path), IGP congruent (unconstrained-path), and static.
   The signaling protocol specific parts of the model are described in
   separate modules for RSVP, segment routing, and LDP.  As mentioned
   earlier, support for BGP labeled unicast is also planned in a future
   revision.

   A module defining various reusable MPLS types is included, and these
   modules also make use of the standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses, as defined in RFC 6991 [RFC6991].

       Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and associated protocols for
       signaling and traffic engineering.

       RFC 3031: Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture

       The MPLS / TE data model consists of several modules and
       submodules as shown below.  The top-level MPLS module describes
       the overall framework.  Three types of LSPs are supported:

       i) traffic-engineered (or constrained-path)

       ii) IGP-congruent (LSPs that follow the IGP path)

       iii) static LSPs which are not signaled

       The structure of each of these LSP configurations is defined in
       corresponding submodules.  Companion modules define the relevant
       configuration and operational data specific to key signaling
       protocols used in operational practice.
