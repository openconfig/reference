    Routing Policy Configuration Model for Service Provider Networks
                   draft-shaikh-rtgwg-policy-model-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing
   routing policies in a vendor-neutral way and based on actual
   operational practice.  The model provides a generic policy framework
   which can be augmented with protocol-specific policy configuration.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC6020] data model for routing
   policy configuration based on operational usage and best practices in
   a variety of service provider networks.  The model is intended to be
   vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators to manage policy
   configuration in a consistent, intuitive way in heterogeneous
   environments with routers supplied by multiple vendors.

1.1.  Goals and approach

   This model does not aim to be feature complete -- it is a subset of
   the policy configuration parameters available in a variety of vendor
   implementations, but supports widely used constructs for managing how
   routes are imported, exported, and modified across different routing
   protocols.  The model development approach has been to examine actual
   policy configurations in use across a number of operator networks.
   Hence the focus is on enabling policy configuration capabilities and
   structure that are in wide use.

   Despite the differences in details of policy expressions and
   conventions in various vendor implementations, the model reflects the
   observation that a relatively simple condition- action approach can
   be readily mapped to several existing vendor implementations, and
   also gives operators an intuitive and straightforward way to express
   policy without sacrificing flexibility.  A side affect of this design
   decision is that legacy methods for expressing policies are not
   considered.  Such methods could be added as an augmentation to the
   model if needed.

   Consistent with the goal to produce a data model that is vendor
   neutral, only policy expressions that are deemed to be widely
   available in existing major implementations are included in the
   model.  Those configuration items that are only available from a
   single implementation are omitted from the model with the expectation
   they will be available in separate vendor-provided modules that
   augment the current model.

2.  Model overview

   The routing policy model is defined in two YANG modules, the main
   policy module, and an auxiliary module providing additional generic
   types.  The model has three main parts:

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model              January 2015


   o  A generic framework to express policies as sets of related
      conditions and actions.  This includes match sets and actions that
      are useful across many routing protocols.

   o  A structure that allows routing protocol models to add protocol-
      specific policy conditions and actions though YANG augmentations.
      There is a complete example of this for BGP [RFC4271] policies in
      the proposed vendor-neutral BGP data model [BGP-Model].

   o  A reusable grouping for attaching import and export rules in the
      context of routing configuration for different protocols, VRFs,
      etc.  This also enables creation of policy chains and expressing
      default policy behavior.

   These modules make use of the standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in RFC 6991
   [RFC6991].

3.  Route policy expression

   Policies are expressed as a sequence of top-level policy definitions
   each of which consists of a sequence of policy statements.  Policy
   statements in turn consist of simple condition-action tuples.
   Conditions may include mutiple match or comparison operations, and
   similarly, actions may effect multiple changes to route attributes,
   or indicate a final disposition of accepting or rejecting the route.
   This structure is shown below.

      +--rw routing-policy
         +--rw policy-definition* [name]
            +--rw name         string
            +--rw statement* [name]
               +--rw name          string
               +--rw conditions!
               |     ...
               +--rw actions!
                     ...

3.1.  Policy conditions

   Policy statements consist of a set of conditions and actions (either
   of which may be empty).  Conditions are used to match route
   attributes against a defined set (e.g., a prefix set), or to compare
   attributes against a specific value.

   Match conditions may be further modified using the match-set-options
   configuration which allows operators to change the behavior of a
   match.  Three options are supported:



Shaikh, et al.            Expires July 27, 2015                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model              January 2015


   o  ALL - match is true only if the given value matches all members of
      the set.

   o  ANY - match is true if the given value matches any member of the
      set.

   o  INVERT - match is true if the given value does not match any
      member of the given set.

   Comparison conditions may similarly use options to change how route
   attributes should be tested, e.g., for equality or inequality,
   against a given value.

   While most policy conditions will be added by individual routing
   protocol models via augmentation, this routing policy model includes
   several generic match conditions and also the ability to test which
   protocol or mechanism installed a route (e.g., BGP, IGP, static,
   etc.).  The conditions included in the model are shown below.

       +--rw routing-policy
         +--rw policy-definition* [name]
           +--rw statement* [name]
             +--rw conditions!
               +--rw call-policy?        -> /routing-policy/...
               +--rw match-prefix-set?   -> /routing-policy/...
               +--rw match-neighbor-set? -> /routing-policy/...
               +--rw match-tag-set?      -> /routing-policy/...
               +--rw match-set-options?     pt:match-set-options-type
               +--rw install-protocol-eq?   identityref
               +--rw igp-conditions

3.2.  Policy actions

   When policy conditions are satisfied, policy actions are used to set
   various attributes of the route being processed, or to indicate the
   final disposition of the route, i.e., accept or reject.

   Similar to policy conditions, the routing policy model includes
   generic actions in addition to the basic route disposition actions.
   These are shown below.

                 +--rw igp-actions
                   +--rw set-tag?   pt:tag-type

3.3.  Policy subroutines

   Policy 'subroutines' (or nested policies) are supported by allowing
   policy statement conditions to reference other policy definitions
   using the call-policy configuration.  Called policies apply their
   conditions and actions before returning to the calling policy
   statement and resuming evaluation.  The outcome of the called policy
   affects the evaluation of the calling policy.  If the called policy
   results in an accept-route (either explicit or by default), then the
   subroutine returns an effective boolean true value to the calling
   policy.  For the calling policy, this is equivalent to a condition
   statement evaluating to a true value and evaluation of the policy
   continues (see Section 4).  Note that the called policy may also
   modify attributes of the route in its action statements.  Similarly,
   a reject-route action returns false and the calling policy evaluation
   will be affected accordingly.

   Note that the called policy may itself call other policies (subject
   to implementation limitations).  The model does not prescribe a
   nesting depth because this varies among implementations, with some
   major implementations only supporting a single subroutine, for
   example.  As with any routing policy construction, care must be taken
   with nested policies to ensure that the effective return value
   results in the intended behavior.  Nested policies are a convenience
   in many routing policy constructions but creating policies nested
   beyond a small number of levels (e.g., 2-3) should be discouraged.

4.  Policy evaluation

   Evaluation of each policy definition proceeds by evaluating its
   corresponding individual policy statements in order.  When a
   condition statement in a policy statement is satisfied, the
   corresponding action statement is executed.  If the action statement
   has either accept-route or reject-route actions, evaluation of the
   current policy definition stops, and no further policy definitions in
   the chain are evaluated.

   If the condition is not satisfied, then evaluation proceeds to the
   next policy statement.  If none of the policy statement conditions



Shaikh, et al.            Expires July 27, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model              January 2015


   are satisfied, then evaluation of the current policy definition
   stops, and the next policy definition in the chain is evaluated.
   When the end of the policy chain is reached, the default route
   disposition action is performed (i.e., reject-route unless an an
   alternate default action is specified for the chain).

5.  Applying routing policy

   Routing policy is applied by defining and attaching policy chains in
   various routing contexts.  Policy chains are sequences of policy
   definitions (described in Section 3) that have an associated
   direction (import or export) with respect to the routing context in
   which they are defined.  The routing policy model defines an apply-
   policy grouping that can be imported and used by other models.  As
   shown below, it allows definition of import and export policy chains,
   as well as specifying the default route disposition to be used when
   no policy definition in the chain results in a final decision.

        +--rw apply-policy
           +--rw import-policies*  -> /rpol:routing-policy/...
           +--rw default-import-policy?   default-policy-type
           +--rw export-policies*  -> /rpol:routing-policy/...
           +--rw default-export-policy?   default-policy-type

   The default policy defined by the model is to reject the route for
   both import and export policies.

   An example of using the apply-policy group in another routing model
   is shown below for BGP.  Here, import and export policies are applied
   in the context of a particular BGP peer group.  Note that the policy
   chains reference policy definitions by name that are defined in the
   routing policy model.

        +--rw peer-group* [group-name]
           |  +--rw group-name                string
           |  +--ro bgp-group-common-state

           |  |  +--rw export-policies*  -> /rpol:routing-policy/...
           |  |  +--rw default-export-policy?   default-policy-type
           ...

6.  Routing protocol-specific policies

   Routing models that require the ability to apply routing policy may
   augment the routing policy model with protocol or other specific
   policy configuration.  The routing policy model assumes that
   additional defined sets, conditions, and actions may all be added by
   other models.

   An example of this is shown below, in which the BGP configuration
   model in [BGP-Model] adds new defined sets to match on community
   values or AS paths.  The model similarly augments BGP-specific
   conditions and actions into the corresponding sections of the routing
   policy model.

7.  Security Considerations

   Routing policy configuration has a significant impact on network
   operations, and as such any related model carries potential security
   risks.

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model              January 2015


   YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the NETCONF
   protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an authenticated and
   secure channel over which to transfer configuration and operational
   data.  Note that use of alternate transport or data encoding (e.g.,
   JSON over HTTPS) would require similar mechanisms for authenticating
   and securing access to configuration data.

   Most of the data elements in the policy model could be considered
   sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized access or invalid
   data could cause major disruption.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This YANG data model and the component modules currently use a
   temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If and when it is placed on redirected
   for the standards track, an appropriate namespace URI will be
   registered in the IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  The routing policy
   YANG modules will be registered in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   [RFC6020].

       configuration parameters available in the variety of vendor
       implementations, but supports widely used constructs for managing
       how routes are imported, exported, and modified across different
       routing protocols.  This module is intended to be used in
       conjunction with routing protocol configuration models (e.g.,
       BGP) defined in other modules.

       Route policy expression:

       Policies are expressed as a set of top-level policy definitions,
       each of which consists of a sequence of policy statements. Policy
       statements consist of simple condition-action tuples. Conditions
       may include mutiple match or comparison operations, and similarly
       actions may be multitude of changes to route attributes or a
       final disposition of accepting or rejecting the route.

       Route policy evaluation:

       Policy definitions are referenced in routing protocol
       configurations using import and export configuration statements.
       The arguments are members of an ordered list of named policy
       definitions which comprise a policy chain, and optionally, an
       explicit default policy action (i.e., reject or accept).

       Evaluation of each policy definition proceeds by evaluating its
       corresponding individual policy statements in order.  When a
       condition statement in a policy statement is satisfied, the
       corresponding action statement is executed.  If the action
       statement has either accept-route or reject-route actions, policy
       evaluation of the current policy definition stops, and no further
       policy definitions in the chain are evaluated.

       If the condition is not satisfied, then evaluation proceeds to
       the next policy statement.  If none of the policy statement
       conditions are satisfied, then evaluation of the current policy
       definition stops, and the next policy definition in the chain is
       evaluated.  When the end of the policy chain is reached, the
       default route disposition action is performed (i.e., reject-route
       unless an an alternate default action is specified for the
       chain).

       allowing policy statement conditions to reference another policy

       results in an accept-route (either explicit or by default), then
       the subroutine returns an effective true value to the calling
       policy.  Similarly, a reject-route action returns false.  If the
       subroutine returns true, the calling policy continues to evaluate
       the remaining conditions (using a modified route if the

10.  Policy examples

   Below we show an example of XML-encoded configuration data using the
   routing policy and BGP models to illustrate both how policies are
   defined, and also how they can be applied.
